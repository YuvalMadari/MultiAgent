# MultiAgent
## Assignment 1: Create & Run a simple multi-agent search (in Java)
****Overview**** 
<br> This assignment is the first stage of creating your final project at the end of the semester. In order to make it incremental,
at this stage you are only asked to implement a module that generates a multi-agent search problem and agents that perform 2 very simple tasks:
<br> &emsp; • Communicate with their neighbors. 
<br> &emsp; • Calculate and publish their relations with their neighbors. 
<br> Some code you will get from us, mainly to help you tackle the multi-threaded synchronization needed for delivering messages.
<br> The code of the agents you will generate yourselves for this environment and it will serve in all your three assignments in this course. 
<br> The main idea is to create and run multiple agents and a random network that connects 
them and to use the communication in order to interact by sending messages via a Mailer. 
<br> The ultimate goal of this and the coming assignments, including the final project, is to solve a distributed problem by multi-agent search.
<br> In order to let you focus on the main goal, we will hand you a partial program that includes the Mailer class that can be used to deliver messages among the agents.
<br> We will also describe the data structure for the random network and relations that will be used as the problem to be solved. 
<br> The required components for this assignment are listed below.
<br> Some of the classes are not fully implemented, and you will have to fill them with your own code.
<br> Please make sure that your implementation is correct, as it will probably serve you for future assignments.
<br> If needed, you can add more classes to your implementation.
